## 0.2.0
 - Improving sentry.rb script based on antho31/logstash-output-sentry and bigpandaio/logstash-output-sentry projects.
 - Creating documentation (starting from bigpandaio/logstash-output-sentry with some fixes for the differences that we have introduced to the code).
## 0.1.0
 - Starting project from clarkdave/logstash-sentry.rb
 - Packing script in a gem so it can be easily installed.
